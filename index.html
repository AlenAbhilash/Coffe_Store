            <p class="type1">Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on
                coffee trees from a
                genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs
                to
                trees.</p>
            <ul class="type2">
                <li><strong>Type of bean.</strong>
                    There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia
                    and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is
                    expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade,
                    humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more
                    economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
                    between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations
                    in rainfall and strong sunlight.</li>
                <li><strong>Type of roast. </strong>
                    Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that
                    releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for
                    brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, lighter the
                    color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular french
                    roast is medium-dark</li>
                <li><strong>Type of grind.</strong>
                    A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used
                    for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Decaffeinated coffee.</strong>
                    This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two rnost

                        Donuts after discussing with company executives.[11][12] He conceived the idea for the
                        restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where
                        donuts and coffee were the two most popular items.</p>
